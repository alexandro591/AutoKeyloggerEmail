# AutoKeyloggerEmail
This a keylogger created by me. It sends the key log information from a computer to your gmail email account, all you have to do is to edit the $gmailusername and $gmailpass in the commands.bat file and theapp.bat file.

A gmail username is for example myusername@gmail.com, in this case myusername is your username and your password is the password of that gmail account. Edit this information in both files mentioned.

Be sure to disable two factor authentication in your gmail account, and enable access through less secure apps.

Also you can send commands to the pc where this is installed, like a terminal, sending an email to yourself and in the subject the command you want to send.
