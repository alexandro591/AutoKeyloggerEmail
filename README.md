# AutoKeyloggerEmail
This a keylogger created by me. It sends the key log information from a computer to your gmail email, all you have to do is to edit the $gmailusername and $gmailpass in the commands.bat file and theapp.bat file.

A gmail username is for example myusername@gmail.com, in this case my username is your username and your password y the gmail pass you have to enter in the script.

Be sure to disable two factor authentication in your gmail account, and enable access through less secure apps.
